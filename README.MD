JmcaC2 Project 

## TODOs

### Detection 
- I'm thinking you can showcase our standard stuff that we've learned in class. Meanwhile I'm going to do the following, I don't think this is necessary but I have the knoweldge so might as well put it to use.

- Parse ETW logs from SilkETW
- Create 2-3 Suricata rules for network IOC and validate them with PCAP of C2 communication
  - (bonus) Include Zeek logs to forward to SIEM
- Create 1 yara and 1 sigma rule and filter those logs using chainsaw before forwarding 
- (Bonus) DFIR setup
